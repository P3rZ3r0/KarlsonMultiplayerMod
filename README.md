# KarlsonMultiplayerMod
 Multiplayer mod for Karlson, very early access though, can be good as a reference point to making mp mods for other unity games using riptide networking
 
 If you just want the mod then go to KarlsonMultiplayer->bin->KarlsonMultiplayer.dll move that to your plugins folder
 
 Please make sure that you have bepinex installed, I am not going to go over the installation of bepinex here
